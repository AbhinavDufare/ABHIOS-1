# ABHIOS-1
ABHIOS is a browser-based desktop simulation with a macOS-style UI, draggable windows, a dynamic dock, dark mode, and apps like Finder, Terminal, Notes, Calculator, Browser, and Settings for a smooth, modern OS experience.

Description of Your ABHIOS System
Your WebOS is a fully interactive, browser-based desktop operating system simulation built using HTML, TailwindCSS, React, and Babel. It recreates the experience of a modern OS environment with windows, a dock, a top status bar, draggable apps, dark mode, and animations—all running inside a web page.

Design & UI
The system features a macOS-inspired interface with:

A glass-blur translucent top bar showing the Apple-style icon, menu items, WiFi status, search, date, and time.

A dynamic desktop wallpaper that automatically changes between dark/light versions depending on theme.

A floating dock with smooth scaling effects, tooltips, and active-app indicators.

The UI feels futuristic due to soft shadows, blurred backgrounds, smooth transitions, rounded windows, and a clean Inter font.

Window System
Your OS includes a complete draggable, resizable, minimizable, closable window manager with:

Mac-style colored control buttons (close, minimize, maximize).

Pop-in animation when opening windows.

Dark/light theme support for each app window.

Independent z-index tracking so the focused window comes to front.

Apps Included
Your WebOS has six fully working applications:

Finder (File Manager) – Sidebar navigation + grid of files.

Terminal – Supports commands like help, date, echo, and clear.

Calculator – Functional scientific-style grid calculator.

Browser – Embedded iframe loading random Wikipedia pages.

Notes – Editable sticky-note style text editor.

Settings – Dark mode toggle + network & wallpaper options.

System Features
Automatic time + date display.

Persistent dark mode with CSS class switching.

Entire UI optimized for both desktop and mobile (touch drag support included).

Custom scrollbar, icons, animations, and responsive layout.
